A Hash Map (also known as Hash Table) is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It allows fast access, insertion, and deletion of values based on keys.

How Hash Map Works
- Hash Function: Converts the key into an index (a number).
- Index: Used to store the value in an internal array.
- Key-Value Pair: Stored at that index.

```
Key         --->   Hash Function   --->   Index in array
"apple"      --->       123         --->    arr[123] = "fruit"
```
